[blog post: Mongo graphql react starter](https://truthseekers.io/how-to-create-a-mongodb-graphql-and-react-app/)

1. in the api/src/index.js, swap out our mongo connection string with your own details.
2. npm install in api/
3. npm install in ui/

npm start in api/ and npm start in ui/ and you should be good to go.
